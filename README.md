## Projects

### Statistical Analysis to Determine the Effects of Covid-19 on Student Scores
A project from my Masters program where I used **SAS and Excel** to lead analysis and visualization. While the title states "...the Effects of Covid-19...", it does not necessarily mean the effects of the actual disease itself, but also the implications and results of Covid-19 policies, social trends, and overall public reaction, which may have negatively affected students.
- Goal: Find a measurable change (if any) in standardized test passing rates for Texas students before and after COVID-19.
- Hypothesis: There will indeed be a measurable and statistically significant **decrease in students' passing rates because of COVID-19**. These decreases will be amplified across minority groups, and economically disadvantaged students.
- **Data:** For this project, my team was given multiple extensive data sets concerning standardized test scores, totalling ~20 Million unique data points covering ALL SCHOOLS in Texas which represents ALL STUDENTS. The standardized test that is required across all students in Texas is the STAAR Test, and these datasets we were given contained incredibly descriptive information reflecting the scores and passing rates for the entire population of Texan students. When combined, these datasets contained key information on student performance by school, as well as demographic information about each school's students and the school itself.

**Results**

- Visual Analysis
  - Purely based on visual analysis, and on the diferences between passing rates before and after COVID-19, **there is a noticable decrease in student passing rates**
    - For all students, Math section passing rates suffered substantially more than other subjects
    - Passing rates for minorities seemed to suffer more
    - Economically disadvantaged students also suffered significantly more than not economically disadvantaged students

- Statistical Analysis
  - Based on visual differences and difference between mean values, student passing rates suffered after COVID-19
  - However, to conclude a true effect from COVID-19, statistical analysis is required
  - In the image above, a statistically significant decrease in each of the 36 variables was recorded when measuring passing rates before and after COVID-19
    - Each "YES" Represents the statistical significance at the 99% confidence level, for each of the 36 variables that were studied
  - t-Tests
    - Lastly, we conducted Two-Sample t-Tests Assuming Equal variances comparing average pass rates in 2019 and 2021 for each subject and found that **the difference in mean passing rates for all students in each subject was statistically significant at the 99% level.**

**Limitations**

- While this analysis revealed some interesting differences from before and after Covid-19, there were some limitations to the study:
  - First, there was some misssing data from certain schools
    - Some schools had in-depth demographic missing
    - A few schools had one or more subjects missing as well
  - Second, the data year range could potentially over-exaggerate the results
    - Because the data provided is only from the years before and after Covid-19, the large difference in passing rates could potentially be because the year after was one of the worst years for passing rates in general
    - This would have to be solved by measuring data from years before and years after the pandemic, which we did not have access to
  - Lastly, the average passing rate was determined by the passing rate for each school
    - This is an issue because each school has a different amount of students, and some lower performaning, small schools would be measured the same as a higher performing, big school
  - Overall, these discrepansies were likely minimal, in terms of affecting the overall results, as this large sample size would likely cover any potential misrepresentations of the data
  
**Conclusion**

- Men and Women
  - Women suffered worse in terms of passing rates as opposed to their male counterparts, even though they had higher scores overall
- Ethnicities
  - Hispanic students witnessed the highest decrease in their passing rates
  - African American students witnessed the second highest reduction
- Economically Disadvantaged Students
  - Economically Disadvantaged students witnessed a significantly higher reduction in passing rates
  - **Being economically disadvantaged could have nearly doubled your chance of failing** in the year after the pandemic
  
**Overall, the statistical findings overwhelmingly indicated that the pandemic had negative effects on all students and their passing rates for standardized tests**

### The Effects of an Aging Population on GDP Growth Rate in the Developed World
Another project from my Masters degree, where me and a group of colleagues saught to discover the effects of an aging population in the developed world, and whether or not it could lead to a decrease in future GDP growth.
- Goal: To present a rational and data driven analysis to capture the effect an aging population has on the growth of a country‚Äôs per-capita economic output
- H<sub>0</sub>: The change in the population of 65+ has a negative effect on GDP per-capita growth.
- H<sub>1</sub>: The change in the population of 65+ has no effect on GDP per-capita growth.
- Data:
  - The World Bank‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorld Development Indicators‚Äù database 
  - The St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) 
  - OECD Data 
  - Population data from several of the census bureau's of developed countries (USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, Japan, and South Korea)

**<a href="https://github.com/thekevinmatz/Kevins_Portfolio/blob/main/The%20Effects%20of%20an%20Aging%20Population%20on%20GDP%20Growth%20Rate%20in%20the%20Developed%20World.pdf">PDF Presentation</a>**

**Conclusion**

- Because the variable for a nation‚Äôs aging population (65<sub>it</sub>) is negative and statistically significant at a 95% confidence interval for all of our regressions, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the change in the population of 65+ has a negative effect on GDP per-capita growth. 
- We can conclude that, in the scope of our model, **as a developed country‚Äôs population ages, they can expect to see a decline in their GDP Per Capita growth rate moving forward.**
